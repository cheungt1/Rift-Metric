# Rift Metrics

## Introduction
An educational game with the aim of providing supplementary learning materials for primary school students. Currently, this is a game that reinforce students' learning by incrementally unlocking new lessons and tutorials upon successful completion of the most recent exercises. By only unlocking lessons when students have successfully completed their exercises, this prove they have a general idea of the learning material. Therefore, there would be a smooth transition to newer topics. This is unlike other learning resources, its purpose is not to be reference materials, but rather assist students learning through a new environment.
