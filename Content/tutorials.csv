1,1,1,1,"Tutorial 1.1: Expressions and Variables
","A variable is a letter to represent one or more numbers.
A variable expression is a sequence of numbers, variables and operations. 
To evaluate a variable expression, replace a number for each variable, thus created a numerical expression. Now solve for a solution of the expression.
A verbal model translates the mathematical expressions to words.
Common Words/Phrases:
	Addition: plus, the sum of
	Subtraction: minus, the difference of
	Multiplication: times, multiplied by
	Division: divided by"
2,1,1,2,Tutorial 1.2: Powers and Exponents,"A power is repeated multiplication of the same number. It has two parts: the base and the exponent.
The base is the number to be multiplied.
The exponent is the number of times the base number is repeated. "
3,1,1,3,Tutorial 1.3: Order of Operations,"Order of operations is the order in which an expression is evaluated (PEMDAS). 
1. Evaluate inner grouping symbols → () [] {}
2. Evaluate powers
3. Evaluate multiplication and division from left to right
4. Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right"
4,1,1,4,Tutorial 1.4: Comparing and Ordering Integers,"Integers are a set of numbers without a decimal point.
Positive integers are a subset of integers that are greater than 0.
Negative integers are a subset of integers that are less than 0.
The absolute value of a number is the distance from 0. This number would always be a positive integer or 0. 
Opposites numbers occur when two numbers have the same absolute value but different signs (+ -)."
5,1,1,5, Tutorial 1.5: Adding Integers & Subtracting Integers ,"Adding integers is combining the absolute value of any two numbers to the left if the second number has a negative sign or to the right if the second number has a positive sign.
Subtracting integers is the same as adding integers of different sign.
Subtraction is a way to evaluate the change of a quantity.

Properties of Addition:
Same Sign: Combine the absolute values of the number (unit)  and use the same sign.

Different Sign: Remove the absolute value of the unit of the lesser value from the greater value.

Opposites (Additive Inverse): The sum of the numbers is 0."
6,1,1,6,Tutorial 1.6: Multiplying and Dividing Integers,"Properties of Multiplication and Division:

Same Sign: The product/quotient of any two integers with the same sign is positive.

Different Sign: The product/quotient of any two integers with the same sign is negative.

0: The product of 0 and any integer is 0."
